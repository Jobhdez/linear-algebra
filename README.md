# linear-algebra

## OVERVIEW
I have implemented some not very efficient matrix algebra.

# How to run
load the system with `(asdf:load-system :linear-algebra)` and run the tests with `(asdf:test-system :linear-algebra-tests)`.

And to be able to use `asdf` you need to put this system's files inside `common-lisp/` otherwise `asdf` will not be able to find your `asd` files.
